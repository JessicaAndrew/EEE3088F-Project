# EEE3088F-Project
Many users are setting up Pis as a home or media server, storage device along with a lot of other uses.The microhat will be used as an UPS (uninterrupted power supply) for the Pi. The HAT will keep a Pi operating during times when itâ€™s power supply is cut. The HAT will have a voltmeter that will lead to the signal line between 0-3.3V so the user will be able to know when to shut down the Pi. The HAT also has an LED to warn the user when the battery is at >80%,50%<v<80%, 20%<v<50% and <20% (very low.)

Subsystem 1:
